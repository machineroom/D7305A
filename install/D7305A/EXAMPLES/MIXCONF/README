SUBDIRECTORY mixconf

This directory contains three examples showing how C code may be called
directly from the occam configurer in both single and multi-processor
configurations. These examples use procedures from the library "centry.lib".
Each program is accompanied by a make file and a linker indirect file as it
is not straightforward to produce these for multiprocessor mixed language
programs with imakef. When using the make files the make macro FLAG should
be defined as / or - according to host.

mixed1.pgm	Single processor program written in C and linked with
mixed1c.c	MAIN.ENTRY to make it callable from occam configuration code
mixed1c.lnk
mixed1.mak

	This example is built by writing:
	make -f mixed1.mak FLAG=-
	Or, equivalently:
	icc mixed1c.c
	ilink -f mixed1c.lnk -mo mixed1c.mod
	occonf mixed1.pgm
	icollect mixed1.cfb -p mixed1.map


mixed2.pgm	2 processor program showing communication between C and
mixed2o.occ	occam processes on two channels in parallel using PROC.ENTRY
mixed2c.c	Both processes can talk to the server.
mixed2c.lnk
mixed2.mak

	This example is built by writing:
	make -f mixed2.mak FLAG=-
	Or, equivalently:
	oc mixed2o.occ -ta -h
	ilink mixed2o.tco hostio.lib convert.lib -f occama.lnk -mo mixed2o.mod -ta -h
	icc mixed2c.c
	ilink -f mixed2c.lnk -mo mixed2c.mod
	occonf mixed2.pgm
	icollect mixed2.cfb -p mixed2.map


mixed3.pgm	A root process in occam, talking to the server and to another
mixed3c.c	process on a separate processor which is coded in C and
mixed3o.occ	called using PROC.ENTRY.RC, which does not treat server
mixed3c.lnk	channels specially.
mixed3.mak

	This example is built by writing:
	make -f mixed3.mak FLAG=-
	Or, equivalently:
	oc mixed3o.occ
	ilink mixed3o.tco hostio.lib convert.lib -f occama.lnk -mo mixed3o.mod
	icc mixed3c.c
	ilink -f mixed3c.lnk -mo mixed3c.mod
	occonf mixed3.pgm
	icollect mixed3.cfb -p mixed3.map
